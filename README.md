# Neuro-fuzzy systems
Lab 1, Lab 2 we will analyze data on college graduate occupations from the American Community Survey 2010â€“2012, which is in the public domain. The work served as the basis for the [ Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/), posted on the [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) website.

Lab 3 use dataset [Student grade pass or fail prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/dinhanhx/studentgradepassorfailprediction). This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools.
